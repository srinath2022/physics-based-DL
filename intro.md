# Welcome to our Physics based Deep Learning Experiments

Hello there!!, we are planning on a set of experiments involving physics based deep learning. We begin by setting up a toy physical simulation and setup a task that can be completed via physics alone
and eventually add complexities to the system and try to leverage deep learning.

# A Gentle Start

Let us start by exploring a simple physics problem of predicting the displacement covered by a vertically projected mass in presence of air. For the purpose of this experiment, we consider that the actual dynamics of the projected mass are modelled by the equations described below which account for resistance of the medium. We will generate ground truth data by applying above motion equations, then assuming we have no knowledge of the actual(with air resistance) dynamics, we perform experiments to predict the displacement in **only physics**, **only deep learning** and **physics + deep learning** setting.


$v_{term} = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{c}}$, where $c = \frac{Ï€}{16}\rho D^2$

For the forward motion from the ground to the top (Ascent)

<!-- $v_t = u_0 - v_{term} tan\left(\frac{gt}{v_{term}}\right)$ -->

$s_t = u_0t + \frac{v_{term}^2}{g} ln\left(cos\left(\frac{gt}{v_{term}}\right)\right) $

$T_{ascent} = \frac{v_{term}}{g} tan^{-1}\left(\frac{u_0}{v_{term}}\right)$

For the return motion from the top to the ground (Descent)

<!-- $v_t = -v_{term} tanh\left(\frac{g(t-T_{ascent})}{v_{term}}\right)$ -->

$s_t = H_{max}-\frac{v_{term}^2}{g} ln\left(cosh\left(\frac{g(t-T_{ascent})}{v_{term}}\right)\right)$

$T_{descent} = \frac{v_{term}}{g} cosh^{-1}\left(e^{\frac{gH_{max}}{v_{term}^2}}\right)$

Total time of flight

$T_{flight} = T_{ascent}+T_{descent}$

**Note :** As ground truth, we consider the quadratic drag model for a projectile from [here](https://dynref.engr.illinois.edu/afp.html) and [here](https://www.physics.udel.edu/~szalewic/teach/419/cm08ln_quad-drag.pdf).   


## The Simulation

We first show a simulation of the proposed particle mass using the above equations for a given initial velocity to get an idea of how the displacement varies with time. We will first calculate the time of flight($T_{flight}$) for the particle, then record displacement covered at each time step starting from $t=0$ to $T_{flight}$ in step sizes of $\frac{1}{5}s$.   

We consider a spherical particle of mass 30g, diameter 2 cm and air density as $1.225 \frac{kg}{m^3}$ for this simulation.

## The Data   

Now that we have a physics simulation, let us run few simulations and collect the data. i,e we input few random initial velocities, times and get the corresponding displacements during the flight.

For this specific task, let us keep the initial velocities between $0$ to $100$ and time step range betwen $0$ to time of flight $T_{flight}$ 

$$u_0 \in (0, 100)$$

The collected data would look like this, $X, Y$ where
$X = (u, t), Y = (s_t)$   
$u, t$ represent initial velocity and time step, where as $S_t$ represents displacement covered after time $t$.

We create a dataset of 10000 points and split the dataset collected into train(80%) and test(20%) respectively.

## Only Physics

We assume that we are not aware of the exact dynamics followed by the particle in the generated data, however we know the equations of motion followed by a particle in vaccum. Using this physics knowledge of ours, let us try to predict the displacement and compare our prediction with the ground truth.

The equations of motion for a vertically projected particle mass in vaccum are as follows.

$S_t = u_0t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$, where $g \sim 10 \frac{m}{s^2}$

We write our prediction function just based on physics, use it to create a simulation and also calculate the loss on the test datset which we have created earlier.

The following figure shows a typical trajectory predicted by physics vs the actual trajectory.

## Only Deep Learing

Now, we try to leverage our modern deep learning techniques to predict the quantities. We will use a simple MLP for the prediction. We start by defining the model and loss employed.

We used a simple model with the folowing architecture.
<!-- TO-DO -->

The loss employed is the standard MSE loss.

After training a few epochs, the loss converged. Using this trained model, we created the simulations and compared with ground truth as shown below.

## Physics + Deep Learning

As we have tried both physics based approach as well as deep learning based appraoch. Let us now combine both of them to train a network which used deep learning as well as the physics. One way to induct physics into DL is by adding appropriate loss function, similar to the below one.

## Comparison

Now that we have seen the three methods for predicting desplacement, Let us try to compare the perfromance of these methods.
The figure below dipicts a plot for comparing the three methods according to the availability of data, showing the test loss trends w.r.t dataset size.

## Conclusion

The loss trends have spikes at some places due to poor convergence of the network, but overall we can conclude that Deep Learning along with physics knowledge can help predict our quantities better.
