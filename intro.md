# Welcome to our Physics based Deep Learning Experiments

Hello there!!, we are planning on a set of experiments involving physics based deep learning. We begin by setting up a toy physical simulation and setup a task that can be completed via physics alone
and eventually add complexities to the system and try to leverage deep learning.
